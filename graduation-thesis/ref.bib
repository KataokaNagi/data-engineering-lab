  abstract = {More and more people read the news online, e.g., by visiting the websites of their favorite newspapers or by navigating the sites of news aggregators. However, the abundance of news information that is published online every day through different channels can make it challenging for readers to locate the content they are interested in. The goal of News Recommender Systems (NRS) is to make reading suggestions to users in a personalized way. Due to their practical relevance, a variety of technical approaches to build such systems have been proposed over the last two decades. In this work, we review the state-of-the-art of designing and evaluating news recommender systems over the last ten years. One main goal of the work is to analyze which particular challenges of news recommendation (e.g., short item life times and recency aspects) have been well explored and which areas still require more work. Furthermore, in contrast to previous surveys, the paper specifically discusses methodological questions and today’s academic practice of evaluating and comparing different algorithmic news recommendation approaches based on accuracy measures.},

  abstract  = {We examine partisan differences in the behavior, communication patterns and social interactions of more than 18,000 politically-active Twitter users to produce evidence that points to changing levels of partisan engagement with the American online political landscape. Analysis of a network defined by the communication activity of these users in proximity to the 2010 midterm congressional elections reveals a highly segregated, well clustered, partisan community structure. Using cluster membership as a high-fidelity (87\% accuracy) proxy for political affiliation, we characterize a wide range of differences in the behavior, communication and social connectivity of left- and right-leaning Twitter users. We find that in contrast to the online political dynamics of the 2008 campaign, right-leaning Twitter users exhibit greater levels of political activity, a more tightly interconnected social structure, and a communication network topology that facilitates the rapid and broad dissemination of political information.},

  abstract   = {The "filter bubble" is a term which refers to people getting encapsulated in streams of data such as news or social network updates that are personalized to their interests. While people need protection from information overload and maybe prefer to see content they feel familiar or agree with, there is the danger that important issues that should be of concern for everyone will get filtered away and people will lack exposure to different views, living in "echo-chambers", blissfully unaware of the reality. We have proposed a design of an interactive visualization, which provides the user of a social networking site with awareness of the personalization mechanism (the semantics and the source of the content that is filtered away), and with means to control the filtering mechanism. The visualization has been implemented in a peer-to-peer social network, called MADMICA, and we present here the results of a large scale lab study with 163 crowd-sourced participants. The results demonstrate that the visualization leads to increased users' awareness of the filter bubble, understandability of the filtering mechanism and to a feeling of control over their data stream.},
