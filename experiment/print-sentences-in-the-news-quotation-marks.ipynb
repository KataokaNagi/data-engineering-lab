But in new court documents, her lawyers say that the \"\"multi-year term\"\" during which she \"\"is one of the most photographed women in the world\"\" could mean millions of dollars for her personal brand. While the new documents don\\'t specifically mention her term as first lady, the unusual statement about her expected profits drew swift condemnation from ethics watchdogs as inappropriate profiteering from her high-profile position, which is typically centered on public service. The statement came Monday in a libel lawsuit the first lady re-filed in a state trial court in Manhattan. Trump has been suing the corporation that publishes the Daily Mail\\'s website over a now-retracted report that claimed she once worked as an escort. In the filing Monday, Trump\\'s lawyers argued that the report was not only false and libelous, but also damaged her ability to profit off her high profile and affected her business opportunities. Trump \"\"had the unique, once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, as an extremely famous and well-known person, as well as a former professional model, brand spokesperson and successful businesswoman, to launch a broad-based commercial brand in multiple product categories, each of which could have garnered multi-million dollar business relationships for a multi-year term during which plaintiff is one of the most photographed women in the world,\"\" the lawsuit said. The products could have included apparel, accessories, jewelry, cosmetics, hair care and fragrance, among others, the suit says. The first lady is seeking compensatory and punitive damages of at least $150 million. Richard Painter, who advised former President George W. Bush on ethics, said the language in the lawsuit shows Melania Trump is engaging \"\"in an unprecedented, clear breach of rules about using her government position for private gain. This is a very serious situation where she says she intends to make a lot of money. That ought to be repudiated by the White House or investigated by Congress.\"\" Painter is part of a group of attorneys suing the president for an alleged violation of a constitutional clause that prohibits presidents from receiving foreign gifts or payments. In response to questions from The Associated Press, Charles Harder, Melania Trump\\'s attorney, said \"\"the first lady has no intention of using her position for profit and will not do so. It is not a possibility. Any statements to the contrary are being misinterpreted.\"\" Harder did not respond to a follow-up question about what the lawsuit means by \"\"once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.\"\" To Painter and others, there is no ambiguity. \"\"She\\'s not talking about the future,\"\" Painter said. \"\"She\\'s talking about earning money now.\"\" Scott Amey, general counsel of the Washington watchdog Project on Government Oversight, said it is \"\"another example of the first family blurring the line between public service and private business interests.\"\" Trump previously filed the lawsuit against Mail Media Inc. in Maryland, but a judge earlier this month ruled the case was filed in the wrong court.

The party-line vote came less than two days after Trump vowed to set up a White House commission helmed by Vice President Mike Pence to pursue his accusations of election fraud. \"\"We\\'re going to look at it very, very carefully,\"\" Trump said of voter fraud in an interview with Fox News that aired Sunday. \"\"It has to do with the registration, and when you look at the registration and you see dead people that have voted.\"\" Reports that Trump told congressional leaders in a meeting last month that 3 to 5 million ballots were cast illegally during the 2016 race were met with discomfort on Capitol Hill. While top Republicans have refused to disavow his charges of election fraud, they haven\\'t pushed for action on the issue, which remains a low priority for congressional leadership. The vote in the House Administration Committee underscored, once again, the political differences between the Republican president and the party\\'s rank-and-file. The GOP majority on the committee eliminated the Election Assistance Commission, which was created by Congress after the 2000 Florida recount to upgrade voting technology and provide election-related information to federal entities, state officials and election administrators. Republicans say the commission is a prime example of government waste. They\\'ve been introducing legislation to end the commission for years with little success. \"\"If we\\'re looking at reducing the size of government this is a perfect example of something that can be eliminated,\"\" said Rep. Gregg Harper, the committee chairman. \"\"We don\\'t need fluff.\"\" Harper said he hadn\\'t spoken to Trump about the legislation. \"\"He\\'s certainly welcome to call me at any time,\"\" he said. The bill was opposed by committee Democrats and voting rights groups, who argued that the federal agency plays a vital role in protecting elections from hacking and other types of interference. \"\"At a time when the vast majority of the country\\'s voting machines are outdated and in need of replacement, and after an election in which foreign criminals already tried to hack state voter registration systems, eliminating the EAC poses a risky and irresponsible threat to our election infrastructure,\"\" said Wendy Weiser, the democracy program director at the Brennan Center for Justice. The committee also voted to terminate the public financing system, which provides major party presidential nominees a lump sum grant of roughly $94.14 million in the general election. But by accepting the grant, a candidate may not raise any additional funds and is severely limited in how much of his own money he can give or lend to his campaign. President Barack Obama effectively ended the practice of candidates taking general election public financing in 2008, when he chose not to accept it. His Republican rival John McCain took the grant that year and was swamped by the Obama campaign\\'s spending. Neither Hillary Clinton nor Trump accepted public financing this year. Money for the public financing of campaigns is collected through voluntary $3 checkoffs on taxpayers\\' returns. The checkoffs do not affect how much money a taxpayer owes. The legislation would devote $63 million of the available funds to pediatric cancer research. The remainder would be returned to the Treasury for deficit reduction.

Most of the sugar comes in breakfast cereals, yoghurts and biscuits. Adults are consuming double the recommended amount of sugar, the organisation added. The FSA welcomed new guidelines published by Public Health England which promised to remove around 200,000 tonnes of sugar from UK diets per year by 2020.

In Northern Ireland, the FSA has been working with small and medium-sized businesses on reducing sugar content. Ms Hancock added: \"\"We know that adults and children in Northern Ireland are eating too much sugar and that most of it comes from everyday foods such as breakfast cereals and yoghurts as well as from foods such as confectionery and biscuits. \"\"That is why the Food Standards Agency\\'s work with the Northern Ireland food industry is vital in reducing the levels of sugar, saturated fat and salt in the food they manufacture, serve or sell, as well as reducing portion sizes in general.\"\" She said healthy choices should be easy to make. \"\"Eating a healthy, balanced diet is a key factor in having good health and achieving and maintaining a healthy weight. \"\"We are committed to collaborating across government and industry in tackling obesity and providing consumers with the opportunities to support and access a healthier lifestyle.\"\"\",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,']\n"," ['3823,2017/3/30,http://www.rte.ie/news/ireland/2017/0330/863913-disabilities-protest-united-nations/,Call for United Nations disabilities convention to be ratified,,\"Hundreds of people with disabilities and their supporters have protested outside Leinster House over the country\\'s failure to ratify the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities over the past ten years.

An inquest into the deaths following a fire at Glenamuck Halting site heard that the garda investigation into the fire is ongoing. The blaze claimed the lives of five adults and five children after it broke out in the early hours of 10 October 2015. The victims were Thomas Connors, 27, his wife Sylvia, 30, and their children Jim, five, Christy, three, and six-month-old Mary; Willie Lynch, 25, his partner 27-year-old Tara Gilbert, who was pregnant, and their daughters Jodie, aged nine, and Kelsey, four; and 39-year-old Jimmy Lynch, a brother of Willy. The victims were residents of Glenamuck Halting site, Carrickmines, Dublin 24. Garda Charlie Dempsey took the stand at Dublin Coroner\\'s Court to confirm the details of the identification process for each individual victim. The five adults and four of the children were identified using DNA evidence, the court heard. Six-month-old baby Mary Connors was formally identified by her relative. The ten post-mortem examinations were carried out by State Pathologist Dr Marie Cassidy and Assistant State Pathologist Dr Margaret Bolster. The cause of death returned for all ten victims of the blaze was acute carbon monoxide poisoning due to smoke inhalation due to a fire. Four relatives of the victims were present in court as Coroner Dr Myra Cullinane outlined the scope of the inquest. She told family members that the inquiry into all ten deaths will be treated as one inquest as the circumstances of all ten deaths are the same. \"\"We will not hold a number of inquests in this case because the circumstances are tragically the same.

Boeri's ambitious design hopes to produce 60 kg of oxygen per day while also absorbing 25 tons of carbon dioxide annually. The future skyscrapers will be located in the Nanjing Pukou District, an area in China that has struggled with heavy smog.- The new towers should be completed by 2018. The tallest is nearly 700 feet high and will house offices, an architecture school and a private rooftop club. The shorter tower will contain a Hyatt hotel and boast a rooftop swimming pool.- As hundreds of millions of people in China are affected by serious air pollution, here's hoping this helps. -\", '\"Chicago\\'s problem has always felt like a minority problem,', 'Lorrendous situation', 'the Undefeated,', 'send in the Feds', \"I hope he's coming in to do some type of federal overturn of our state and city budgets in terms of schooling and housing,\", \"I'm tired of n***as talkin\", \"He sounds like he was going to go to war with Chicago.

Each of these flaws is examined further, below. Airbnb does not ask hosts or guests for information related to their racial identity. As a result, the authors of this report attempted to determine the race of individual hosts by using suspect technology to rifle through Airbnb users\", 'self-identify', 't have it. Furthermore, while the author uses self-identification data from the Census to identify the race of residents, racial information for Airbnb hosts is not derived from self-identification. As a result, the comparisons between residents and hosts are fundamentally flawed. One of the first lessons of Research 101 is that any legitimate study has to have an experimental group and a control group to measure against. However, this study has no control group. Instead, even setting aside the concerns raised in #1 above, the author only analyzes disparities between residents and Airbnb hosts in Black neighborhoods. Without performing a similar analysis in White neighborhoods, they cannot rule out alternative explanations for the disparity.- It is possible, for instance, that a disproportionate share of Airbnb hosts are White because White New Yorkers are significantly more likely than Black or Hispanic New Yorkers to own their homes (42 percent of Non-Hispanic White New Yorkers own their homes, only 27 percent of Black New Yorkers and 15 percent of Hispanic households own theirs).

The affected area is considered a strategic trade route that leads through the Suez Canal, linking oilfields of the Middle East with European ports. Modern piracy of the coast of Somalia dates back to 2005. Attacks on ships by pirates off the Horn of Africa have been declining since Operation Atalanta, a European mission to secure the region's water for shipping, got underway in 2008. But now the problem is on the rise in the Gulf of Guinea. EU leaders are preparing to announce a strategy to increase security efforts in the region. The International Maritime Bureau in London, which monitors pirate activities, has reported at least 10 incidents in the Gulf of Aden and at least 28 in the Gulf of Guinea in 2013. The number of attacks on the Horn of Africa has been falling steadily: Last year, 75 ships were reported attacked and 237 in 2011. In the Gulf of Guinea, 58 incidents were recorded in 2012, compared to 64 in 2011. Failed governance in Somalia led to overfishing of its coastline by other countries in the early 1990s. Toxic waste was subsequently dumped in its waters, crippling the local fishing industry. The combination of factors caused some Somalis to resort to piracy, while others later determined it was a good way to make money. Piracy surged in Somali waters in the late 2000s. Pirate attacks along the Horn of Africa have decreased since the international naval presence there was bolstered. In 2012, 35 ships were attacked by pirates off the coast of Somalia, compared with 163 in 2009. In former piracy hotspots, locals are more concerned about fishing than capturing cargo ships. Those captured and accused of piracy can face trial far from their home countries. Where they end up depends on who catches them or the ship they attacked. In 2012, for example, 10 Somalis were sentenced to jail by a Hamburg court for attacking a German-flagged ship. The UN and EU are backing efforts to improve the judicial systems closer to where pirates operate. West African pirates' methods can be more violent than those off the Horn of Africa. While Somali pirates know they will forfeit ransom if their hostages come to harm, pirates in the west are mainly interested in the oil or valuable cargo on board and less concerned about the people. Their hijacking methods are similar - approaching large vessels out at sea in small craft. In the West, Nigeria has been exporting oil for the past 20 years, but most of its people have not benefited from the extensive revenues. Almost two-thirds of Nigeria's population lives below the poverty line. To those without livelihoods, the risks of piracy can seem worth it. Political instability and social conflict have left room for pirate gangs to consolidate in the Gulf of Guinea. While a heavy international military presence was effective in reducing piracy near Somalia, the same solution cannot easily be applied to the Gulf of Guinea. As those countries are sovereign states, their own authorities must work together to find a solution. Still, international interest in finding an answer is high, especially since the region supplies 20 percent of Europe's oil and gas. The key to reducing piracy is improving people's lives on land. The challenges are vast - from improving judicial systems to creating a sustainable economy to effectively managing the consequences of natural disasters - like here in a Somali food aid facility where families received rations during a severe drought in 2012.

But the Trump administration canceled some planned digital and television advertising and, this year, only about 400,000 people signed up in the final two weeks. In the same period last year, 700,000 did.

The bill would, however, immediately eliminate the individual mandate, which incentivizes healthy people to sign up for insurance by imposing a financial penalty on people who do not. For that reason, the Congressional Budget Office this week predicted that, for the first two years, the Republican proposal would actually cause premiums to rise. But afterward, CBO predicted, less comprehensive plans would come to dominate the market, while older people, who would find policies both less generous and more expensive, would drop coverage altogether.

Seamus Coleman was stretchered off as a result of the red card offence, which saw Neil Taylor sent off for a nasty-looking challenge on the Ireland skipper and O'Neill later confirmed that his leg was broken and that the Donegal man was on his way to hospital.- Wales had enjoyed the lion's share of the possession in the opening half but failed to break through a well-organised and disciplined Ireland defence as neither side really threatened a breakthrough. Chris Coleman's side started the second period as they finished the first, on the front foot, and Real Madrid star Gareth Bale looked to be honing in on the Ireland goal with two chances within two minutes. And the Wales talisman really showed his class for that second effort that whistled past the far post as he took on a snapshot from an audacious angle. Shane Long dragged Ireland into the contest in the 60th-minute as the half wore on as his aggressive running and closing down allowed Ireland to see their first decent spell of possession in the opponents\", 'hea, team-mate Taylor followed up a moment later with that mis-timed tackle on Coleman, who was charging through at full pace before he was scythed down. A straight red followed and then the sustained Ireland attack really started to put pressure on the visitors', \"Neill's side came to scoring was a James McClean right-footed volley which looked to be flying into the back of the net but was deflected wide. The magnificent Bale was lucky to end the match on the pitch as he should have received a second yellow card for another late challenge with five minutes remaining. And then a solo effort from the Madrid man almost decided the contest as he raced clear, cut inside and smashed a near-perfect effort, arrowed towards the top corner. The ball flew past the wrong side of the post and while it would have been a fitting goal to decide such an exciting contest, it would have perhaps been harsh on the hosts, with the draw being the fair result over the entire 90 minutes. Wales were better than us on the night, admits James McClean after the draw against Wales pic.twitter.com/SEcdYoG9hS \", 'hea had clear the ball before Bale, with studs showing, caught the Ireland centre-half but the Madrid man was surprisingly only shown a yellow card for the over-zealous challenge. Bale should certainly have picked up a second yellow late in the game and while the Italian referee had to be commended for letting the game flow, he certainly got the big decisions wrong, which will ultimately leave the Ireland captain out of action for some time. Bale Watch The Real Madrid man looked head and shoulders over every Irish player on the pitch from the opening exchanges with his movement, quick-thinking and early delivery. Playing a more central role, the Madrid man failed to really threaten the Irish goal in the first half, although he came close to setting up some excellent opportunities for his team-mates on occasion. His star shone at times in the second half with a couple of goalbound efforts that just flew past the post, but his high profile is what probably saved him a red card as he could have been sent off twice in this encounter. Overall, Ireland will be happy with the way they marshalled him and the defence will be very content with the clean sheet.

That is really remarkable,-that a senator blocking a treaty that is supported by an overwhelming number, perhaps 98 at least, of his colleagues would come to the floor and object and walk away. And walk away! The only conclusion you can draw when he walks away is he has no argument to be made. He has no justification for his objection to having a small nation be part of NATO that is under assault from the Russians.

Initially, more than half the states did precisely that.

The immediate consequence of refusing to expand Medicaid was to deprive- millions of Americans living in those states of insurance. But those decisions also had a spillover effect.

Rather, it uses a long-discredited methodology akin to racial profiling.

Many of my friends, male and female, experience stress, sadness, and longing at this time of year, and while I understand how they might feel this way, to dwell in a depressive state focused on that which seems lacking is ultimately a waste of time and energy.

And then a solo effort from the Madrid man almost decided the contest as he raced clear, cut inside and smashed a near-perfect effort, arrowed towards the top corner.

No one seemed to know where Nunes had gotten this information, and the congressman, who went to the White House to brief the president on his findings, would only say that he had an anonymous source. He has refused to name his source even to Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), the ranking Democrat on the intelligence committee.

The end of open enrollment period has historically seen a surge of signups, as people rush to meet the deadline, and the late signups tend to be healthier on average, helping the risk pool. But the Trump administration canceled some planned digital and television advertising and, this year, only about 400,000 people signed up in the final two weeks. In the same period last year, 700,000 did. That drop may help explain why, this year, overall signups for HealthCare.gov policies fell slightly this year.-It's also a reminder that the kind of people who have been trying to undermine Obamacare are now in charge of it.

Ana had her interview on Feb. 27, the day the new rules went into effect. Claims for asylum-(and other forms of relief from deportation) can often take years to settle, so most who pass the credible-fear interview are released from detention while their cases wind through the courts. But a negative ruling on credible fear prevents immigration judges from setting bond hearings for those detained and makes deportation quicker and easier.

The bill would, however, immediately eliminate the individual mandate, which incentivizes healthy people to sign up for insurance by imposing a financial penalty on people who do not. For that reason, the Congressional Budget Office this week predicted that, for the first two years, the Republican proposal would actually cause premiums to rise. But afterward, CBO predicted, less comprehensive plans would come to dominate the market, while older people, who would find policies both less generous and more expensive, would drop coverage altogether. As a result, premiums would grow at a slower rate, eventually dipping down below where they would be if the Affordable Care Act had stayed in place. And they come down even more if Republicans found a way to further weaken regulations, through either executive action or future legislation \n","t really done much on repeal yet. But it's poised to act quickly if and when the House sends over a bill.-Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has said he will bring legislation directly to the floor for a vote, bypassing committees altogether. If the Senate votes yes, then it would just be a matter of working out differences between the chambers, to whatever extent they exist, so that Congress could send a final bill to President Donald Trump for his signature. In the seven years since the Affordable Care Act became law, Republicans have frequently attacked Democrats for supposedly crafting legislation in secret and then rushing votes before lawmakers really understood what it would do. In reality, those deliberations lasted more than a year, with hundreds of hours of hearings and floor debate and with CBO estimates guiding discussion at every step. That contrast was a topic of frequent discussion during Wednesday's hearings, with Democrats proposing amendments that would have prohibited votes before hearing from the CBO \n","t have to just be buildings anymore.

Boeri's ambitious design hopes to produce 60 kg of oxygen per day while also absorbing 25 tons of carbon dioxide annually. The future skyscrapers will be located in the Nanjing Pukou District, an area in China that has struggled with heavy smog.- The new towers should be completed by 2018. The tallest is nearly 700 feet high and will house offices, an architecture school and a private rooftop club. The shorter tower will contain a Hyatt hotel and boast a rooftop swimming pool.- As hundreds of millions of people in China are affected by serious air pollution, here's hoping this helps. -\n","t many big banks currently publishing ETF research, but they do exist.

Bale should certainly have picked up a second yellow late in the game and while the Italian referee had to be commended for letting the game flow, he certainly got the big decisions wrong, which will ultimately leave the Ireland captain out of action for some time. Bale Watch The Real Madrid man looked head and shoulders over every Irish player on the pitch from the opening exchanges with his movement, quick-thinking and early delivery. Playing a more central role, the Madrid man failed to really threaten the Irish goal in the first half, although he came close to setting up some excellent opportunities for his team-mates on occasion. His star shone at times in the second half with a couple of goalbound efforts that just flew past the post, but his high profile is what probably saved him a red card as he could have been sent off twice in this encounter. Overall, Ireland will be happy with the way they marshalled him and the defence will be very content with the clean sheet. Man of the Match \n","Neill's side enjoyed a sustained spell of pressure for the final third of the game but could not find a way through to goal as they enjoyed an extra man for the final 25 minutes. Seamus Coleman was stretchered off as a result of the red card offence, which saw Neil Taylor sent off for a nasty-looking challenge on the Ireland skipper and O'Neill later confirmed that his leg was broken and that the Donegal man was on his way to hospital.- Wales had enjoyed the lion's share of the possession in the opening half but failed to break through a well-organised and disciplined Ireland defence as neither side really threatened a breakthrough. Chris Coleman's side started the second period as they finished the first, on the front foot, and Real Madrid star Gareth Bale looked to be honing in on the Ireland goal with two chances within two minutes. And the Wales talisman really showed his class for that second effort that whistled past the far post as he took on a snapshot from an audacious angle. Shane Long dragged Ireland into the contest in the 60th-minute as the half wore on as his aggressive running and closing down allowed Ireland to see their first decent spell of possession in the opponents\n","t have it. Furthermore, while the author uses self-identification data from the Census to identify the race of residents, racial information for Airbnb hosts is not derived from self-identification. As a result, the comparisons between residents and hosts are fundamentally flawed. One of the first lessons of Research 101 is that any legitimate study has to have an experimental group and a control group to measure against. However, this study has no control group. Instead, even setting aside the concerns raised in #1 above, the author only analyzes disparities between residents and Airbnb hosts in Black neighborhoods. Without performing a similar analysis in White neighborhoods, they cannot rule out alternative explanations for the disparity.- It is possible, for instance, that a disproportionate share of Airbnb hosts are White because White New Yorkers are significantly more likely than Black or Hispanic New Yorkers to own their homes (42 percent of Non-Hispanic White New Yorkers own their homes, only 27 percent of Black New Yorkers and 15 percent of Hispanic households own theirs).

The affected area is considered a strategic trade route that leads through the Suez Canal, linking oilfields of the Middle East with European ports. Modern piracy of the coast of Somalia dates back to 2005. Attacks on ships by pirates off the Horn of Africa have been declining since Operation Atalanta, a European mission to secure the region's water for shipping, got underway in 2008. But now the problem is on the rise in the Gulf of Guinea. EU leaders are preparing to announce a strategy to increase security efforts in the region. The International Maritime Bureau in London, which monitors pirate activities, has reported at least 10 incidents in the Gulf of Aden and at least 28 in the Gulf of Guinea in 2013. The number of attacks on the Horn of Africa has been falling steadily: Last year, 75 ships were reported attacked and 237 in 2011. In the Gulf of Guinea, 58 incidents were recorded in 2012, compared to 64 in 2011. Failed governance in Somalia led to overfishing of its coastline by other countries in the early 1990s. Toxic waste was subsequently dumped in its waters, crippling the local fishing industry. The combination of factors caused some Somalis to resort to piracy, while others later determined it was a good way to make money. Piracy surged in Somali waters in the late 2000s. Pirate attacks along the Horn of Africa have decreased since the international naval presence there was bolstered. In 2012, 35 ships were attacked by pirates off the coast of Somalia, compared with 163 in 2009. In former piracy hotspots, locals are more concerned about fishing than capturing cargo ships. Those captured and accused of piracy can face trial far from their home countries. Where they end up depends on who catches them or the ship they attacked. In 2012, for example, 10 Somalis were sentenced to jail by a Hamburg court for attacking a German-flagged ship. The UN and EU are backing efforts to improve the judicial systems closer to where pirates operate. West African pirates' methods can be more violent than those off the Horn of Africa. While Somali pirates know they will forfeit ransom if their hostages come to harm, pirates in the west are mainly interested in the oil or valuable cargo on board and less concerned about the people. Their hijacking methods are similar - approaching large vessels out at sea in small craft. In the West, Nigeria has been exporting oil for the past 20 years, but most of its people have not benefited from the extensive revenues. Almost two-thirds of Nigeria's population lives below the poverty line. To those without livelihoods, the risks of piracy can seem worth it. Political instability and social conflict have left room for pirate gangs to consolidate in the Gulf of Guinea. While a heavy international military presence was effective in reducing piracy near Somalia, the same solution cannot easily be applied to the Gulf of Guinea. As those countries are sovereign states, their own authorities must work together to find a solution. Still, international interest in finding an answer is high, especially since the region supplies 20 percent of Europe's oil and gas. The key to reducing piracy is improving people's lives on land. The challenges are vast - from improving judicial systems to creating a sustainable economy to effectively managing the consequences of natural disasters - like here in a Somali food aid facility where families received rations during a severe drought in 2012.
